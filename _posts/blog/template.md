To create a new blog post:

1. Make a copy of this file and save it in the `_posts/blog` directory with a name that follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`
  * For example: `_posts/blog/2017-04-28-Hello-world.md`
2. In your new file update the header information:
  * Update the title by replacing "INSERT TITLE" on line 3 with the title
  * Add an excerpt if you'd like. This will be seen on the blog landing page or the search page. Try to keep the excerpt only one short sentence long. 
  * Update the tags by removing "INSERT TAGS IF APPLICABLE" with comma separated tags
    * Eg: `onboarding, data science`
  * Update the date with today's date (or the date you want the post to go live) by replacing the date on line 9.
  
3. Write the blog post! You can use markdown to format the text. Check out this handy dandy [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [adam-p](https://github.com/adam-p).
