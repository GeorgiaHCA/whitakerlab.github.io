I've been off the grid over new year in a [beautiful hut in Northumbria](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/948461671915376640). We did have phone signal (but no wifi), and I was reading twitter, but I was also trying to decompress and spend time with my partner so I didn't do a huge amount of communicating online.

That meant I missed the opportunity on New Years Day to celebrate some of my friends being acknowledged as [APS Rising Stars](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-Rising-Stars.pdf) :star2::sparkles::dizzy: and [Prof Ian Goodyer](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2938057) made an OBE (Order of the British Empire) in the New Years Honours.

I'm so proud of them that I've found some pictures of us all together for this post!

## APS Rising Stars

The [Association for Psychological Science](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/) names Rising Stars each year to "outstanding psychological scientist in the earliest stages of their research careers post-PhD". Four of my friends are on the list.

### Allyson Mackey

Ally is truly one of my absolute favourite scientists. We did our PhDs together at UC Berkeley and I credit her with absolutely everything I know about Neuroscience. I can't tell you how many times I've spun around in my chair, or in more recent years, pinged her over iMessage to ask "What is it I'm trying to say here??". The answer is always better than I could have written myself.

Allyson has a lab at U Penn and focuses on understanding brain development, in particular in relation to interventions that can support people from low socio-economic backgrounds. She's a kickass mom to the wonderful Clara and one of the most empathetic researchers I've ever met.

You can find out more about Allyson at [thechangingbrain.com](http://www.allysonmackey.com/) and follow her on twitter [@ally_mackey](https://twitter.com/ally_mackey).

### Chris Madan

I met Chris at [Neurohackweek 2016](http://neurohackweek.github.io/) but we'd interacted on twitter before then! He's wonderful to follow: passionate about brain structure, science communication, open science, and encouraging community in all of our research endeavours. He now has a research lab at the University of Nottingham and I'm very sure his team will produce fantastic work in the next few years!
